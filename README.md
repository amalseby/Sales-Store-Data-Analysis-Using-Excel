Conclusion:

To maximize future sales and customer engagement, we recommend a targeted approach focused on specific demographics and platforms. Firstly, directing marketing efforts towards customers in the age group of 25 to 45, with a particular emphasis on female shoppers, can optimize sales conversion rates. Offering personalized offers, discounts, or loyalty programs can incentivize this group to make repeat purchases.

Secondly, prioritizing marketing campaigns and product launches during March, the peak sales month, can lead to increased visibility and customer participation.

Furthermore, concentrating expansion efforts and resources in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh would enable a more effective utilization of resources and facilitate deeper penetration into high-potential markets.

Lastly, collaborating closely with popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart will grant wider exposure and access to a substantial customer base. Utilizing targeted advertisements on these platforms will aid in reaching potential customers and driving more sales.
